## HOW TO PLAY
A dealer (the house) and one or more players are required to play. There is no general limit to the number of players that can participate, which is one of the reasons it makes an excellent party game. Each round begins when the dealer shakes the dice (which are covered in a dice bowl/plate). Players may guess the at the dice and place wagers on 0 or more character spots on the game board after the dice have been shaken. The dealer reveals the dice by uncovering the dice after all wagers have been placed. If one or more of the dice match the player's wager, the house (dealer) must pay the player the wager amount.If the multiple dice match the player's wager, the dealer is required to pay the player his wager multiplied by the number of dice that match. If none of the dice match the player's wager, the wager is accepted by the dealer.
